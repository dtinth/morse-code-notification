MCN (Morse Code Notification)
===

When a notification is received, vibrates the phone using morse code.

For example, if you get a notification with title "Hello World,"
it will find the initial letters (HW), turns that into morse code (`..../.--`),
and vibrates the phone.

There are existing apps in the Play Store, but they don't offer enough customization.
This one does, by means of modifying the source code by yourself. :P

To use, install this app and go to "Settings," then "Security Settings,"
and enable "Notification Access" for the MCN app.
